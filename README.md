# Repository for the Schema.org Accessibility Properties for Content Discoverability

This repository is where the vocabularies of terms are maintained for the following schema.org accessibility properties:

- [accessibilityAPI](https://schema.org/accessibilityAPI)
- [accessibilityControl](https://schema.org/accessibilityControl)
- [accessibilityFeature](https://schema.org/accessibilityFeature)
- [accessibilityHazard](https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard)
- [accessibilitySummary](https://schema.org/accessibilitySummary)
- [accessMode](https://schema.org/accessMode)
- [accessModeSufficient](https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient)

For more information about the original development of these properties, please refer to the [a11ymetadata.org web site](http://www.a11ymetadata.org/about/).

## Governance

These vocabularies are maintained by [Accessibility Discoverability Vocabulary for Schema.org Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/a11y-discov-vocab/).

The chairs of the Community Group are responsible for ensuring the smooth functioning of the group and resolving any issues that might arise.

The group is currently chaired by Charles Lapierre, Madeleine Rothberg and Matt Garrish. Please feel free to reach out to any of these individuals if you have concerns about the way the group is operating.

## Mode of Operation

The Community Group anticipates using the GitHub tracker in this repository to discuss and resolve issues.

The Community Group will endeavour to gain consensus on issues before resolving them, but complete consensus of all participants is not required in order to progress a resolution.

The chairs may periodically request teleconferences to discuss items. For example, if consensus cannot be reached through the tracker, if there are proposals that require group discussion, or if the group determines there are new work items that cannot be initiated through the tracker. In these cases, the date of the meeting and agenda will be sent to the Community Group's email list in advance of the call. Minutes for all meetings will be posted to the Community Group's home page.

The Community Group may also hold meetings or get togethers at larger W3C events, such as TPAC.

## Participation

It is not required to join the [Accessibility Discoverability Vocabulary for Schema.org Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/a11y-discov-vocab/) in order to raise issues or engage in discussion in the tracker. Only a GitHub account is required.

Individuals interested in this work are strongly encouraged to join the group, however, as only participants of the Community Group may engage in group teleconferences and other meetings.

## Contributing to the Repository

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informative by, for example, including the issue or bug number.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the vocabulary or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.

## Publishing New Revisions

Only chairs of the Community Group may publish new versions of the vocabulary.

The chairs will endeavour to republish the vocabulary whenever consensus on proposed changes is reached and a pull request is ready to be integrated.

Exceptions to this rule may occur at the chairs' discretion. For example, if multiple issues need to be resolved for a new version to make sense, or if many small issues are expected to be resolved within a short period of time, so the work of republishing for each is not warranted.

## Code of Ethics

The Community Group operates under the W3C's [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).
